'''
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines
are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis
forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water
(blue section) the container can contain is 49.

Example:

Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49

            if height[L] < height[R]:
                res, L = max(res, height[L] * w), L + 1
            else:
                res, R = max(res, height[R] * w), R - 1
